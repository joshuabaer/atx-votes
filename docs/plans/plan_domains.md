## Priority Ranking

### Tier 1 - Register Immediately (before March 3 primary)

These are the most strategically important and should be registered first:

| # | Domain | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **texasvotes.app** | Matches your brand name; highest risk of someone else grabbing it |
| 2 | **austinvotes.app** | Your home market; ATX Votes brand recognition |
| 3 | **dallasvotes.app** | #1 metro area expansion target by population |
| 4 | **houstonvotes.app** | #2 metro area expansion target by population |
| 5 | **sanantoniovotes.app** | #3 metro area expansion target by population |

**Tier 1 estimated cost: ~$70/year (5 domains x ~$14)**

### Tier 2 - Register Before General Election (by October 2026)

| # | Domain | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 6 | **fortworthvotes.app** | Major city, pairs with Dallas for DFW coverage |
| 7 | **dfwvotes.app** | Regional abbreviation, covers Dallas-Fort Worth metro |
| 8 | **htxvotes.app** | Houston abbreviation, popular local usage |
| 9 | **txvotes.com** | Protects brand in .com; people default to typing .com |
| 10 | **txvotes.org** | Protects brand in .org; civic/nonprofit credibility |

**Tier 2 estimated cost: ~$64/year (3 x $14 + 2 x $11)**

### Tier 3 - Register If Budget Allows

| # | Domain | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 11 | **satvotes.app** | San Antonio abbreviation (SAT also = airport code) |
| 12 | **elvotes.app** | El Paso - smaller market but potential confusion with Spanish "el" |
| 13 | **rgvvotes.app** | Rio Grande Valley - niche regional, less name recognition |

**Tier 3 estimated cost: ~$42/year (3 x $14)**

| **Porkbun** | $10.81 (sale) | $14.93 | First-year discount. Free WHOIS privacy + SSL. |
| **Namecheap** | $12.98 | ~$14-15 | Established, good bulk tools. |
| **NameSilo** | ~$14-15 | ~$14-15 | Bulk discount program available. |

## Recommended Registrar: Cloudflare

**Why Cloudflare is the best choice for this project:**

1. **You already use Cloudflare Workers** for txvotes.app - all DNS, routing, and SSL are already managed there
2. **At-cost pricing** with no markup - $14.20/yr for .app is the wholesale price
3. **No renewal price surprises** - same price every year (no first-year teaser rates)
4. **Free WHOIS privacy** included
5. **Free SSL** (required for .app domains) - automatic with Cloudflare
6. **Instant DNS propagation** since you control the nameservers
7. **Easy Worker routing** - point any new domain to the same Worker with a single route rule

**Limitation:** No bulk registration UI. You must register each domain individually through the dashboard. For 5-13 domains, this is manageable (takes ~2 minutes each).

**Alternative:** Register first year at **Porkbun** ($10.81/domain for .app) for a lower upfront cost, then transfer to Cloudflare before renewal. Porkbun also includes free WHOIS privacy and SSL.

## Cost Summary

| Scenario | Domains | Year 1 Cost | Annual Renewal |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tier 1 only** (5 .app) | texasvotes, austin, dallas, houston, sanantonio | ~$71 | ~$71 |
| **Tier 1 + Tier 2** (10 domains) | + fortworth, dfw, htx, txvotes.com, txvotes.org | ~$135 | ~$135 |
| **All domains** (13 domains) | + sat, el, rgv | ~$177 | ~$177 |
| **Porkbun Year 1** (13 .app + 2 other) | All domains, first-year promo | ~$143 | ~$177 (at CF) |

---

## Timeline Recommendation

| When | Action |
|---|---|
| **NOW (Feb 22, 2026)** | Register Tier 1 domains immediately. Early voting is underway; primary is March 3. If the app gets press coverage, someone could squat these domains. |
| **March-April 2026** | Register Tier 2 domains. Post-primary is a quieter period with lower squatting risk. |
| **By September 2026** | Register any remaining Tier 3 domains before the general election media cycle heats up. |
| **October 2026** | All domains should be registered before the November 3 general election. |
| **Ongoing** | Set all domains to auto-renew. Domain expiration during election season would be catastrophic. |

## Technical Notes for Multi-Domain Setup

Once domains are registered on Cloudflare, pointing them to the existing Worker is straightforward:

- Add each domain as a zone in Cloudflare
- Add a Worker route: `*domainname.app/*` -> `txvotes-api`
- The Worker can detect the hostname via `request.headers.get('host')` and serve city-specific content
- Alternatively, all domains can simply redirect to txvotes.app with a city parameter

No code changes are needed just to register and park the domains. The domains can initially redirect to txvotes.app and be activated with city-specific content later.
