In June 2025, Governor Abbott signed SB 1362, an 'Anti-Red Flag Act' that bans the enactment or enforcement of Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPOs) in Texas — moving in the opposite direction from this proposition. A multistate study found that one suicide was averted for every 17 ERPOs issued. Twenty-one states and D.C. currently have red flag laws. The proposition specifically targets the intersection of domestic violence and firearms, calling for ERPOs when there is documented domestic abuse history.",
      "fiscalImpact": "Non-binding advisory. Implementation would require judicial infrastructure for ERPO hearings and a firearms tracking system. Studies from other states show ERPOs are cost-effective compared to the economic toll of gun violence — the average gun homicide costs society an estimated $1.4 million in medical, criminal justice, and lost productivity costs.",
      "supporters": ["Texas Gun Sense", "Moms Demand Action Texas", "Everytown for Gun Safety", "Texas Council on Family Violence", "National Domestic Violence Hotline (headquartered in Austin)", "American Medical Association"],
      "opponents": ["National Rifle Association (NRA)", "Gun Owners of America", "Texas State Rifle Association", "Gov. Greg Abbott (signed the Anti-Red Flag Act)", "Some civil liberties advocates concerned about due process in ERPO proceedings"],
      "ifPasses": "Signals Democratic voter support for red flag laws focused on domestic violence, directly contradicting the 2025 Anti-Red Flag Act. Provides a sharp general election contrast on gun safety. Could motivate suburban voters, particularly women, who support common-sense gun measures.",
      "ifFails": "Would suggest the Democratic base is divided on gun policy, perhaps due to concerns about government overreach or Second Amendment protections. Could lead candidates to soften gun safety messaging."
