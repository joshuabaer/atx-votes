BUILT FOR AUSTIN

ATX Votes covers the full Travis County ballot — from U.S. Senate and Governor down to Railroad Commissioner and local propositions. Whether you're voting in the Republican or Democratic primary, the app tailors everything to your specific ballot and districts.

YOUR PRIVACY MATTERS

Your data stays on your device. We don't create accounts, don't track you, and don't store your information on our servers. Your address is used once to look up your districts and is never saved remotely.

AI-generated recommendations are a starting point, not a final answer. We encourage you to do your own research. Democracy works best when voters show up informed.
